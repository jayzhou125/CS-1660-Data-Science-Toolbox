# CS-1660 Data-Science-Toolbox Final Project
This Data Science ToolBox is a Web Application that use docker to deploy each micro-services. 

## Before starting the tool box
Make sure you have docker installed.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo to your local directory. 
2. `cd` in your local directory and look for a file named `docker-compose.yml`
3. If you have docker installed, run `docker-compose up -d` to have the application running. 
	 Docker will then look up images needed for the application, since the images are already push to the docker hub, just wait till it finishes downloading the 	
	 images.
